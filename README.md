# Advent of Code 2022
Yup, Rust again.

## Notes
I overengineered a bit, for learning purposes. Don't overthink about it.

### Day 1
I knew that I would need to reuse something from the P1 on P2, but I didnt know what,
so I solved P1 first. Then I realized what I could reuse and decided to solve P2 before
refactoring.

Reused an iterator. I could have reused something easier (or nothing), but was curious about how to do it.

### Day 2
Parsing as tuples.

I felt very dirty doing it. I was about to do something harder, but focused on getting the answers first
and didn't overcomplicate myself.

### Day 3
Building helping functions to use in iterators.

### Day 4
Finding the right boolean expression.

### Day 5
Welcome to Parsing Hell!

The input was the true puzzle.

### Day 6
I could have used a vector of chars to collect the input, but wanted to keep the original form.

I decided to return the marker/message and the first time it appeared, just in case I needed everything later.

It felt easy.
