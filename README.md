# Advent of Code 2022
Yup, Rust again.

## Notes
I overengineered a bit, for learning purposes. Don't overthink about it.

### Day 1
I knew that I would need to reuse something from the P1 on P2, but I didnt know what,
so I solved P1 first. Then I realized what I could reuse and decided to solve P2 before
refactoring.

Reused an iterator. I could have reused something easier (or nothing), but was curious about how to do it.
